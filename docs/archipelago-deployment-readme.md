# Archipelago Docker Deployment

**Updated:** January 30th 2024

**Previously Updated:** October 31st 2023

This repository serves as bootstrap for a Archipelago 1.3.0 deployment on a localhost for development/testing/customizing via Docker and provides a more unified experience this time:

- minio.io (latest with Gateway Support) S3/Azure/Local/Remote alternative with Console.
- Apache Solr 9.1 with the wizardly Solr OCR Highlight library [v0.8.4](https://github.com/dbmdz/solr-ocrhighlighting/releases/tag/wip) built by the Developement Team at the [Bavarian State Library](https://github.com/dbmdz). Thanks Johannes Baiter and team.
- MySQL 8.x (amd64/x86)/MariaDB 10.6.x(Arm64/M1/M2/M3)
- NGINX 11
- Custom PHP-FPM 8.1 multi architecture, fine-tuned for Drupal 10 , WARC to WACZ processing, Tesseract 5 with JP2 support, PDFAlto and Composer 2.x, Drush 12, etc
- Natural Language Processing via NLPWEB64 multi architecture with FastText Language detection (Thanks Mike Bennet!)
- Cantaloupe 6.0.1 Snapshot multi architecture as IIIF2/3 Server with Video Frame extraction and PDF support (with custom fix for tiled PDF)
- A Skeleton Project setup to run latest Version of Drupal (10.1.x), our new Bootstrap 5 theme and Strawberry Field modules on 1.3.0 & friends on 0.7.0
- Complete support for Apple Silicon *M1* Machines and in general `arm64` architecture Chips like Raspberry Pi 4, with specially built arm64 docker containers. The only differences now between deployment strategies is the DB. Blazing fast OCR.

The skeleton project contains all the pieces needed to run a local deployment of a vanilla Archipelago including (*YES*!) content provided as an optional feature from [archipelago-recyclables](https://github.com/esmero/archipelago-recyclables)

# Starting from ZERO

This is the recommended, simplest way for this release. There are a too many, tons of fun new features, Metadata Displays, Webforms, New formatters and Twig extensions, improved viewers, new and improved JS libraries, OpenCV/Face Detection, smarter NLP, File composting, better HUGE import/update capabilities, bug fixes (yes so many) so please try them out. The team has also updated the DEMO AMI set (Content) to showcase metadata/display improvements.
